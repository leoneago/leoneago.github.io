I am a population geneticist and marine molecular ecologist working as a researcher at the Department of Earth and Marine Sciences (DiSTeM) of the University of Palermo, Italy. Former postdoctoral researcher at Ifremer, France and AZTI-tecnalia, Spain. Former PhD student at the University of Bologna, Italy. My scientific work is focused on molecular ecology, population genetics/genomics, phylogeography, micro and macro evolution processes of marine organisms with a special interest in sharks and rays. I combine DNA metabarcoding, population genetics and genomics to approach questions on population composition, distribution, structure and connectivity of marine species. Actually I'm involved in the application of marine environmental DNA to assess biodiversity and connectivity.
