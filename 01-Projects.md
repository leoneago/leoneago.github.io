Through genome-representative and ddRAD-derived SNP markers, we are investigating the population structure of the Mediterranean and North East Atlantic blue shark, in order to delineate the number of populations detecatable in the study areas. Genome-representative markers allows a way deeper search for population genetic signals capable to discriminate different populations, which may be under the effect of separate demographic processes. This is mandatory to better manage the stocks and preserve their resilience under the direct and undirect anthropogenic pressures (overfishing, loss of habitat, climate change, etc.).
The MedBlueSGen project is funder by the Joint Research Center of the European Union, and the project website can be seen

Using genome-wide SNP markers, we are investigating the population structure of this common but still enigmatic deep-sea rockfish, together with its genomic adaptation to the extreme environments where this species live.
Analasyng genome-wide markers of blackbelly rosefish catched at several depths (from 50 to 700 meters), we are conducting genotype-environment analysis to reveal is the adaptation to specific depths are shaping different populations of this small but territorial rockfish.
The results will facilitate a sustainable management of this fishing resources.
The project is part of the ATLAS project, visible <a href="https://www.eu-atlas.org/">here</a>.
